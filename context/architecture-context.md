## System Boundaries

- `src/screens/` — Page-level route components. One file per route. Each screen composes section components.
- `src/components/ATLAW/` — Shared section components, header, footer. No business logic.
- `src/data/` — Static content data. Single source of truth for copy, navigation links, team info.
- `src/motion/` — Animation primitives and scroll config. No content or layout.
- `public/` — Static assets served as-is. Images, fonts, logos.

## Routing Model

- All routes defined in `src/index.tsx`.
- Homepage is eagerly loaded (LCP route).
- All other pages are lazy-loaded with `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>`.
- Fallback during lazy load: branded `LoaderOverlay` component.
- `ScrollToTop` resets scroll position on route change.
- `NavigationLoader` shows a progress bar during route transitions.

## Image Strategy

- Primary format: AVIF (with PNG/JPG/WebP fallbacks where needed).
- Hero images preloaded in `index.html` `<head>` for LCP.
- Conversion scripts in `scripts/` use sharp.
- New photos from `Website Materials/ATLAW Updated Photos/` to replace placeholder images.

## Animation System

- GSAP ScrollTrigger drives all scroll-based animations.
- Lenis provides smooth scroll, synced with GSAP's scroll clock.
- Motion primitives in `src/motion/primitives/`:
  - `RevealText` — word-by-word text reveal on scroll.
  - `RevealBlock` — fade-up block reveal.
  - `RevealStagger` — staggered children reveals.
  - `RevealImage` — image reveal with curtain effect.
  - `DrawRule` — animated horizontal rule.
  - `Counter` — animated number count-up.
  - `Parallax` — depth-shifted background elements.
- `prefersReducedMotion()` check disables animations for a11y.

## Invariants

1. No practice areas other than PI sub-practices appear in navigation or marketing copy.
2. Dewnya Bazzi is the only attorney featured on the homepage hero.
3. Intake form links point to the Typeform URL — no custom form backend.
4. Attorney advertising disclaimer appears in the footer of every page.
5. All images use AVIF with appropriate fallbacks.
6. Font files are self-hosted, not loaded from Google Fonts CDN.
7. Every page includes Header and Footer components.
